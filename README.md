# Stock Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** for analyzing stock market sentiment based on textual data. It uses various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning models** to predict sentiment (positive or negative) from stock-related text data.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download NLTK data:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook `stock_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` to execute the entire pipeline:

```
jupyter notebook stock_sentiment_analysis.ipynb
```

## Data

The project uses a dataset (`stock_data.csv`) containing stock-related text and corresponding sentiment labels. Ensure this file is placed in the `dataset/` directory.

## Methodology

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the stock data.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize the text data.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Naive Bayes
   - Decision Tree
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Neural Network
   - XGBoost

## Results

The project compares the performance of different models using cross-validation scores and test accuracy. Results are visualized using a bar plot for easy comparison.
